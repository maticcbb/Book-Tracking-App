# MyReads Project
Author - Mateusz Mielcarz

Based on the start template for the final evaluation project of the Udacity React Fundamentals course, I built functional applications.

The base project was downloaded from Udacity GitHub.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
